# If clash

Unfortunately, if you do the paste operation with Swagger Editor running, it may occasionally crash.

f you crash while Swagger Editor is running, you can execute the following command to reflect the editing status up to a few seconds before in the local file.

```bash
bundle exec rake routes:oas:analyze
```

It is a file generated by parsing the generated file oas_doc.yml and dividing it into each file.

## Attention

Please be aware that if you execute the following command immediately after the crash, the change history will be `lost`.

```bash
bundle exec rake routes:oas:editor
```
